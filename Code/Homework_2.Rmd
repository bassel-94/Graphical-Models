1. For an adjacency matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and $ \mathbb{1} \in \mathbb{R}^n$

a. We can write the expression of $\boldsymbol K$ the vector of degrees of the vertices, as follows : 

$$
K = A \times \boldsymbol1 \text{ where } K \in \mathbb{R}^n
$$

b. If we have $n$ nodes, there are $n-1$ directed edges than can lead from it (going to every other node). 
Therefore, the maximum number of edges in a directed graph is $n \times(n-1)$
